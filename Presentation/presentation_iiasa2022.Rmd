# Conclusions

<!-- - CFR decline may **not** imply that vaccines are being effective in reducing deaths -->


- A constant CFR can **still** mean that vaccines are effective in reducing deaths


- Detecting infections among both the vaccinated and unvaccinated population is key 

--

### Take-away: unless vaccinated people are **also** tested, it is hard to use the CFR as an indicator for monitoring the pandemic
